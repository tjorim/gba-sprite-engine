#### General explanation

The goal of this game is to get Kirby as high up as possible. This can be accomplished by jumping on platforms.
Make sure you don't hit the ground or touch one of the spiky balls  that drop from the sky.

#### Controls

Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow to move and press A to jump. When you die, press START for a quick restart or SELECT to go back to the startscreen.

#### Small tips

- You can stay on a moving platform by using the LEFT and RIGHT key to move along with the platform.
- You can drop to the first platform beneath the platform you are currently standing on if you have no way to go.
- It's a hard game that takes practice. (My personal best was a score of 1708 after a lot of testing and practice.)
