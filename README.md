## Superluigi

A GBA game written in c++ by Craeghs Mathias and Vandebosch Remy.

In this game you play as Luigi. He runs through a single level world searching for adventure.
A world filled with monsters that can be slayed by jumping on top of them.
Luigi strives to go forward using the right key and jumping to new heights using the up key.
Luigi can solve all problems using his head. Literally using his head, hit it on the bottom of the questionblock to gain a point.
For every five points an extra life is acquired.
