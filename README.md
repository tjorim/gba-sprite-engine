[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wgroeneveld/gba-sprite-engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wgroeneveld/gba-sprite-engine)

### Information
This is a project for [3433 Softwareontwerp met C/C++ en Qt](https://uhintra03.uhasselt.be/studiegidswww/opleidingsonderdeel.aspx?a=2018&i=3433&n=4&t=01). The goals of this project was creating a GBA demo based on the [gba-sprite-engine](https://github.com/wgroeneveld/gba-sprite-engine) of [wgroeneveld](https://github.com/wgroeneveld). The demo I created is a 2D fighting game that's inspired on the classic dragonball series, you're fighting with the saiyan kid goku (孫悟空 Son Gokū) also known as kakarot (カカロット Kakarotto) at the world tournament
against yamcha (ヤムチャ yamucha). Because it's just a demo you can  control and fight with goku but yamcha will not defend himself.

### Controls and rules

a: kick 

b: hit

left or right: moving left or right

green bar is your health bar, blue  bar is your energy bar

The kamehameha wave needs energy, you cannot replenish you energy

The game ends when your opponents health is 0, press start to restart the game
