B: 				shoot blue portal
L: 				rotate visor counter clock wise
R: 				rotate visor clock wise
Left Arrow: 	walk left
Right Arrow:	walk right

#### Additional information

- In the game level, the game runs very slow. Set de emulation speed x4 for a normal in game speed.
- To exit a horizontal portal from above, press the jump button.
- Sometime the game doesnt render sprites. But they are still there and collision detection works fine.
